Financial Results Impact: Google search traffic notably increased on May 5th and 6th, coinciding with the release of MercadoLibre's 1st Quarter financials on May 5th, 2020.
Time-Based Trends: Traffic tends to surge on Mondays after 10 am, peaking at 8 pm, and slows significantly between 12 am and 10 am. There are also seasonal trends, with peaks observed in the first weeks of the year.
Common Trends: While initial market shocks were followed by increased search activity and stock prices, the evidence of a consistent trend is somewhat limited. However, around May 5th, 2020, there was a notable spike in both search traffic and stock price, suggesting a possible common trend.
Relationship Analysis: There's a slight negative correlation between search activity and subsequent stock volatility, indicating reduced short-term hourly stock risk with increased search activity. Conversely, a positive correlation exists between search activity in one hour and subsequent stock returns, although it's notably weak.
Forecast for MercadoLibre's Popularity: The near-term forecast for MercadoLibre's popularity indicates a negative trend.
Peak Popularity Time: Search traffic peaks at 12 am (24 hours).
